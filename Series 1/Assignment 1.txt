Questions:
1. Which metrics are used?
2. How are these metrics computed?
3. How well do these metrics indicate what we really want to know about these systems and how can we judge that?
4. How can we improve any of the above?


- Question 1
Based on the information listed in the paper, the following metrics are used in the proposed SIG Maintainability Model:
	- Volume: The overall volume of the source code influences the analysability of the system.
		= Lines of Code
		= Man years via backfiring function points
		= Other volume measures
	
	- Complexity per unit: The complexity of source code units influences the system’s changeability and its testability.
		= Cyclomatic complexity per unit
		= Other complexity measures
	
	- Duplication: The degree of source code duplication (also called code cloning) influences analysability and changeability.
		= Duplicated blocks over 6 lines
	
	- Unit size: The size of units influences their analysability and testability and therefore of the system as a whole.
		= Lines of code per unit
	
	- Unit testing: The degree of unit testing influences the analysability, stability, and testability of the system.
		= Unit test coverage
		= Number of assert statements
	
The scale of the grading is ++ / + / 0 / - / --
